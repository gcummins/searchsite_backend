    Create an alternate, image-free, link-only menubar for the application. Consider making the entire application skinnable.
       This may be useful because the original design requirement was provided over three years ago, and the interface is no longer
       on par with current standards.

    Check the dialog handling in the Rediration module. Problem:

      - Click "Cancel"

    Update the "Top Deals" table to match the look and feel of Categories/redirection/etc.
    Add a cancel button to the user "edit" function in the User Manager.
    (optional) Modify the edit function to match the dialog used in other modules.
### Complete the "Edit" function for the Categories module
    Categories Module: When a category banner expires, it should be replaced by a default banner.
    Categories Module: The Top Deal expiration date is for a banner that shows at the top of the right column.
       Once it expires it should not show on the site.
    Categories Modules: "stores" link. This link should allow the admin to select which stores are joined to a category.
